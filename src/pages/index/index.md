    We are a [student-led technology
    society](https://www.rusu.co.uk/societies/15199/) based here at the
    [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/). We are driven to provide
    exciting opportunities for our members to build their _skills_ as well as a
    _professional network_. Our events are the perfect opportunity for both
    newcomers and seasoned techies alike to collaborate & learn, facilitated by
    our support and resources.

      **Hackathons** are events where people from multiple disciplines can team
      up to create a quick and demonstrable version of their project. The teams
      compete to see which project will be deemed the best by experts in the
      industry and can win prizes! Hackathons are often themed around a certain
      topic, but can often be free-form! Our society aims to provide some
      mini-hacks and similar events throughout the year with our big 24-hour
      Hackathon being held in February, 2019.

      Building from our Hackathon last year, we're aiming to put our Alumni
      prize award towards equipping our hardware lab for Hackathon attendees to
      make use of. Some of the hardware will include low-power microcontrollers
      and potentially some Virtual Reality equipment! Last year's event had some
      very solid entries, to the point where it was difficult to choose the
      overall best, so definitely come down and make something you can boast
      about on your CV!

    All of our regular activities will be based here on Whiteknights campus! As
    we're a student society, we'll use the Students' Union as a meeting point
    for town events. Some local campus events might have different meeting
    points (e.g. the Computer Science department).

    It's Hacktoberfest 2018! Proudly brought to you by the team at the Reading
    University Hacking society, let's celebrate open source over food, drinks,
    learning, and great company! Bring your laptop and positive attitude!


    Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub
    and Twilio — is a month-long celebration of open source software.
    Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors towards issues that
    will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to
    give back to both projects they like, and ones they've just discovered. No
    contribution is too small—bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways
    of participating.
