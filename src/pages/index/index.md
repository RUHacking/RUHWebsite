      Hackathons are events where people from multiple disciplines can team up
      to create a quick and demonstrable version of their project. The teams
      compete to see which project will be deemed the best by experts in the
      industry and can win prizes! Hackathons are often themed around a certain
      topic, but can often be free-form! Our society aims to provide some
      mini-hacks and similar events throughout the year with our big 24-hour
      Hackathon being held in February.

      Building from our Hackathon last year, we're aiming to put our Alumni
      prize award towards equipping our hardware lab for Hackathon attendees to
      make use of. Some of the hardware will include low-power microcontrollers
      and potentially some Virtual Reality equipment! Last year's event had some
      very solid entries, to the point where it was difficult to choose the
      overall best, so definitely come down and make something you can boast
      about on your CV!

    R. U. Hacking? works hard to provide our members with strong links to local
    industry leaders, that's why we actively seek industry partners to come and
    provide talks and workshops at our events. This offers an excellent platform
    for our students to create ties with businesses while at University and get
    a good foothold for when looking for placements.
